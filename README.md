# Perceptron
Perceptron java class with subclasses, neuron and neural net, in order to create a fully functioning perceptron machine. <br>
The file, prompter.java, asks for the user to input a file for either setting the weights for the perceptron, which will then use the file for training, or to
input a file for the previously trained perceptron to interpret. In the examples provided, this perceptron takes an input of a matrix representing a letter using bipolar values. 1 being
what makes the shape of the letter, and -1 being blank space.
